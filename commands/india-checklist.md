# /india-checklist

Interactive non-code compliance checklist for Indian law items that cannot be verified
from the codebase — business registration, appointments, insurance, operational procedures.

## Usage

```
/india-checklist
/india-checklist <area>
```

Area values: `dpdp`, `cert-in`, `rbi`, `business`, `health`, `all`

## What this command does

Ask the user a series of yes/no/partial questions about non-code compliance items.
For each item:
- State the obligation in plain language
- State the law and section
- Ask: "Done / In progress / Not done / Not applicable"
- If "Not done": give a concrete first action to take

At the end: print a summary of gaps with severity and first-action steps.

## Instructions for the AI

When the user runs /india-checklist:

1. Ask which area to cover first, or confirm "all" if no argument given.
2. For each item in the area, present it as a question:
   "**[Law §Section]** [Plain-language obligation] — Done / In progress / Not done / N/A?"
3. Accept free-text or choice answers.
4. For "Not done" answers: give one concrete first action, e.g., "Register at gst.gov.in > New Registration > Services category."
5. At the end: print a gap summary table with severity and first-action column.
6. Remind: "This is not legal advice. Consult a lawyer for compliance decisions."
