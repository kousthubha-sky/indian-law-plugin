# DPDP Act 2023 — Obligations

Every app that collects, stores, or processes personal data about Indian residents is a
**Data Fiduciary** and must comply. "Personal data" means any information that can
identify a natural person (name, email, phone, IP address, device ID, location, etc.).

## Phase timeline (verify current dates at meity.gov.in before citing)

| Phase | Effective Date | Status (as of Jun 2026) | What goes live |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | Nov 14, 2025 | ACTIVE | Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) established; definitions; administrative provisions |
| **Phase 2** | Nov 13, 2026 | ACTIVE | Consent Manager Framework operational; all Data Fiduciaries must integrate with a registered Consent Manager |
| **Phase 3** | ~May 14, 2027 | COMING — no grace period | Full substantive obligations: consent & notice, data principal rights (access/correction/erasure/grievance), breach notification (72h), children's data rules, significant data fiduciary requirements |

**Key facts:**
- DPDP Rules 2025 were notified by MeitY and set out the detailed procedural requirements.
- The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) is the enforcement authority — file breach notifications and complaints there.
- Phase 3 has **no grace period** — non-compliance on day 1 of enforcement attracts full penalties.
- Penalty schedule: ₹250 crore for breach of data principal rights or security obligations; ₹200 crore for children's data violations; ₹50 crore for failure to notify a breach; ₹10,000 for minor procedural lapses.
- **DPDP phase dates have shifted before** — always confirm current schedule at meity.gov.in before advising a client.
