# Report Format Reference

## Output file

| `high` | Core compliance requirement; gap is likely discovered in any audit | Consent, data-deletion right, encryption at rest, privacy policy |
| `medium` | Important but context-dependent or phased | Cross-border disclosure, grievance SLA, accessibility |

## Confidence notes for AI

- Mark findings `confidence: high` only when the evidence is clear (file found / missing,
  pattern matched, dependency present).
- Mark `confidence: medium` when you're inferring from indirect signals (e.g., no deletion
  route in routes file, but could be in another file).
- Mark `confidence: low` / `not-auto-verifiable` when you can't confirm from the codebase.
- Never invent a finding. A missing signal means "not found" — note it as such.
